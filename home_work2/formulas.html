 <h3>Mathematical formulas</h3>
 <h5>Linear Equations</h5>
A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form

  <div><span>ax + b = 0</span></div>    

where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are real numbers and <b>x</b> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <b>x</b> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <b>x</b> there.

 <h5>Quadratic Equation</h5>

The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

 <div> <span>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span> </div>   

where <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are known values and <b>x</b> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <b>a</b> can't be 0.

<h5>The area of a circle (A)</h5>

 <b>&#960;</b> (Pi) times the radius (<b>r</b>) squared:

  <div><span>A = &#960; &times; r<sup>2</sup> </span></div>  

or, when you know the diameter (<b>D</b>):
  <div><span>A = (&#960; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup> </span></div>  

or, when you know the circumference (<b>C</b>):
 <div><span>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &#960;</span></div>  

  <h5>Intersection</h5>

The intersection of two sets <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoted by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,

 <div><span>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B } </span> </div> 

That is, <b>x</b> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <b>x</b> is both an element of <b>A</b> and an element of <b>B</b>.
